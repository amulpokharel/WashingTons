Beginning July 1, 1997, clothing manufacturers may use certain care symbols in place of words on permanent labels inside garments to indicate a method for proper cleaning. (Written descriptions will also be included for the first 18 months.) The following is a foolproof guide to deciphering these new symbols found on your garment care labels.

Note: At a minimum, laundering instructions include, in order, four symbols: washing, bleaching, drying, and ironing. Dry cleaning instructions include one symbol. Additional symbols or words or both may be used to clarify the instructions. The water temperatures listed are provided as a guideline. Actual water temperatures obtained in the home depend on the washing machine settings (hot, warm, cold), regional water supply temperatures, and water heating settings.
